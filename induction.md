# Induction for new trainers and helpers

## Overview

Research IT delivers most of its training in the form of 1-day courses,
which are open to applications from staff and PG students.
The current [list of courses][schedule] is scheduled in advance for the whole year,
but extra courses can be added throughout the year if required.

## Where and when?

Courses are typically scheduled mid-week, because it doesn't interfere with anyone
taking a long weekend, and anecdotally it gives better attendance.

Courses can run online (Zoom), or on campus, at the discretion of the trainer.

### Admin checklist for instructors

- [ ] set up a Zoom event / book a [teaching room](https://resourcebooker.manchester.ac.uk/)
- [ ] create new events in the [training catalogue]
- [ ] update the custom reminder email with Zoom/room details
- [ ] move applicants from the waiting list onto the new event
- [ ] find helpers for the course
- [ ] create an Outlook calendar event and invite helpers and
  ResearchITNews@manchester.ac.uk

Research IT News is invited to the event for promotional and scheduling purposes.
The Research IT News newsletter promotes training, so this is the easiest way to
communicate the course details.

## Teaching format

We teach mostly in the style of Software Carpentry i.e. live-coding / code-along
see [Instructor Training] and [Teaching Tips].



## Feedback and attendance

Helpers are encouraged to give (constructive) feedback to the trainers.

Feedback should also be solicited from the attendees,
and where possible the trainer should aim to respond to it during the course.

A short feedback questionnaire is to be completed by attendees,
which can also be used to record attendance for the course.
This should be processed by the trainer in the training catalogue.

Marking those who haven't completed the feedback as 'failed to attend' seems to
be the most reliable way to elicit a feedback form response.

## Managing bookings

This is the responsibility of the trainer and is done through the [training catalogue].

Most courses are set for 'unmoderated online booking', but the waiting list is a misnomer.
People can apply to the waiting list if the event is full, but if someone with a
place cancels, the place is not filled automatically from the waiting list.

As such, when you receive an email alert informing of a cancellation, you should
review the waiting list and manually transfer applications to a course event.

An overview of how to use the training catalogue is given in the [guide],
but the waiting list management is detailed below:

Click the participants tab, select *waiting list* as the event,
and status as *pending*, then click on *filter*.
Select the students you want to move to the event,
and change new status to *confirmed*, and click the *override constraints*
button.
Then choose update status and set their event to the one you
want to move them to.

## Checklist for trainers before teaching

- Collect and charge microphone the day before if it's an on-campus event
- Get some sticky notes if you're using them
- Check you have helpers, and that they are aware of this
- Fill empty places from the waiting list when you get cancellations

## Checklist for helpers

- Read the course material and ensure you understand the exercises
- Walk round the room --- learners will often 'grab' you for help if you're close by
- Look out for learners requesting help via sticky notes
- Give feedback to the trainer as required e.g.
  - too fast/ too slow
  - can't read screen
  - can't hear them
  - how long is the break
- Think about what went well and what didn't for post-course feedback

## Software

We no longer tend to use PC clusters, so learners will typically use their laptop.

As such, instructions on how to install software should be sent in the course reminder email.

I usually try to help with any setup difficulties on the day, 
but stress that the course teaches the tool rather than the setup, and they should
submit a support ticket if it can't be resolved quickly or during a break.


## External attendees

Sometimes we have requests to accommodate external applicants.
This is extra work because if the learner brings their laptop and can't access eduroam,
this can be a deal breaker.
A 'conference plus' temporary account can be requested in advance, which gives a log in
for the training PCs. It's extra admin, so we only want to do this if the external applicant
is paying to attend a course. This is currently being investigated as a thing.

## External trainers

Occasionally an external trainer will teach a course which Research IT will organise locally.
Where possible we get the trainer to manage registrations. Previous such courses have been
run by ARCHER and NAG among others.

## Workshops

Software Carpentry workshops are run occasionally. These are two-day training courses which can
be a bit frantic. They need a central teaching room to be booked which is big enough for the number
of applicants, plus a bit of extra space to move around.
On top of a normal course, we need to remember:

- set up a [workshop website](https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template)
- trailing power sockets, so the learners can power their laptops
- extra helpers for set-up problems, compared with a normal 1-day workshop using training PCs
