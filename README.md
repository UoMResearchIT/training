# Software Carpentry workshops
Workshops run by Research IT are listed below, but other groups at the University Of Manchester
also run workshops.
[The carpentry events web page](https://uomresearchit.github.io/carpentries-manchester/) (GitHub [repo](https://github.com/anenadic/carpentries-manchester))
is an effort to list all the Software and Data Carpentry workshops in one place.
